//! Which encrypted operands are **query operands** rather than stored values.
//!
//! An encrypted value reaches PostgreSQL in one of two shapes. A *stored value*
//! carries the column's whole payload — the ciphertext `c` plus every search
//! term. A *query operand* carries the terms but **never** a decryptable
//! ciphertext; the `eql_v3.query_*` domains enforce that with a `NOT (VALUE ?
//! 'c')` check.
//!
//! The two are indistinguishable by type: the operand of `WHERE col = $1` and
//! the value of `INSERT ... VALUES ($1)` are both [`crate::EqlTerm::Full`]. What
//! separates them is where they appear, which is what this records.
//!
//! The proxy needs it because it cannot encrypt a multi-term operand directly —
//! a single `EqlOperation::Query` yields only one term, so an operand is
//! encrypted in Store mode and then projected
//! (`EqlCiphertextV3::into_query_operand`). Without knowing the role it would
//! send a stored payload into a query position and PostgreSQL would reject it.
