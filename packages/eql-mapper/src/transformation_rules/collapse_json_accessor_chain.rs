/// Collapses a multi-step encrypted JSON accessor chain into a SINGLE accessor
/// on the root document:
///
/// - `col -> 'a' -> 'b'` → `eql_v3."->"(col, <sel>)`
/// - `col -> 'a' ->> 'b'` → `eql_v3."->>"(col, <sel>)`
/// - `jsonb_path_query_first(col, '$.a') -> 'b'` → `eql_v3."->"(col, <sel>)`
///
/// where `<sel>` is the chain's OUTERMOST selector operand, encrypted to key the
/// whole composed path (`$.a.b`) rather than the one segment its text spells.
/// The proxy composes that path from [`crate::JsonAccessorPaths`], which the type
/// inferencer recorded against this same operand.
///
/// A chain cannot be two hops. `eql_v3."->"` searches the document's `sv` array,
/// and what it returns is one entry with no `sv` of its own — so an accessor
/// applied to the result of an accessor finds nothing and returns NULL. That is
/// the failure this rule exists to prevent, and it is silent: the query runs.
///
/// Only the OUTERMOST node of a chain is rewritten, and it is rewritten in one
/// step from the chain's root, so the intermediate accessors are discarded whole.
/// Every plaintext selector in them goes with them — leaving one behind would ship
/// a field name to PostgreSQL in the clear (CIP-3682) as well as applying native
/// jsonb `->` to an encrypted payload.
///
/// # Relationship to the other JSON rules
///
/// This runs BEFORE [`super::RewriteContainmentOps`], which functionalises a
/// single `->`, and replaces the node with the finished call so that rule declines
/// (it requires its target to still be a `BinaryOp`). Doing it here rather than
/// leaving a one-step `BinaryOp` behind keeps the cast decision keyed to the
/// operand that actually survives: `RewriteContainmentOps` would read the type of
/// the ORIGINAL left operand, which for a chain is the discarded inner accessor.
///
/// For an EQUALITY over a chain this rule still fires, on the accessor below the
/// comparison, and its result is then discarded by
/// [`super::RewriteJsonValueSelectorEq`] — which re-roots the containment at the
/// bare column read from the original AST. Equality keys path and value into ONE
/// needle, which is strictly stronger than an accessor plus a comparison, so it
/// must keep winning.
