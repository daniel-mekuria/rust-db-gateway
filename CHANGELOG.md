# Changelog

All notable changes to CipherStash Proxy will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **`UPDATE … SET … FROM` with same-named columns**: an `UPDATE` was rejected as ambiguous when a table in the `FROM` clause had a column with the same name as the column being assigned. The assignment now always refers to the table being updated, so these statements work and the assigned value gets the target column's type — encrypted or not.

- **Encrypted values as row counts are rejected**: an encrypted column used in `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`, or `FETCH` (for example `LIMIT enc_col`) is now rejected with a type error instead of being forwarded to the database.

- **Statements Proxy cannot type-check fail with a clear error**: a statement Proxy admits for type checking but has no support for is now rejected immediately with an error naming the statement, instead of surfacing later as an opaque resolution error. No currently-supported statement is affected.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-05

### Changed

- **EQL v3 (searchable encryption)**: Proxy now targets EQL v3. Encrypted columns are declared with self-configuring, typed `jsonb` domains (for example `eql_v3_text_search`, `eql_v3_integer_ord`, `eql_v3_json_search`) that encode both the scalar type and the column's searchable capabilities in the column type itself, replacing EQL v2's opaque `eql_v2_encrypted` composite type and its separate `eql_v2_configuration` table. The bundled `cipherstash-client` is upgraded to 0.42.0 and EQL to 3.0.4. Existing v2-encrypted data and schemas must be migrated to v3.

### Added

- **Encrypted full-text match with `@@`**: The `@@` operator is now supported on encrypted text columns whose domain carries a match (bloom-filter) term, rewritten to the EQL v3 `eql_v3.match_term` form.

- **`SELECT DISTINCT` on an encrypted column now deduplicates**: `DISTINCT` used to compare whole encrypted payloads, whose ciphertext is randomised per row, so equal plaintexts never collapsed and `DISTINCT` silently returned duplicates. It is now keyed on the column's equality term — `SELECT DISTINCT ON (eql_v3.eq_term(col)) col …` — so one row is returned per distinct plaintext. Deduplication is equality, so a column whose domain carries no equality term (`eql_v3_boolean`, for instance, which is storage-only) is now rejected with a capability error rather than silently returning every row.

- **`SELECT DISTINCT` ordered by an encrypted column**: `SELECT DISTINCT … ORDER BY <encrypted column>` now works. Ordering an encrypted column requires its ordering term, which PostgreSQL will not accept under `DISTINCT` unless it also appears in the select list, so the query is rewritten to project the term from a subquery and order the outer query by it. The term is never returned to the client and column names are preserved. Two shapes remain unsupported and are reported as such: `SELECT DISTINCT ON (…)` and `SELECT DISTINCT *`, both when combined with `ORDER BY` on an encrypted column — list the columns explicitly for the latter.

- **Equality on encrypted JSON fields**: `WHERE col -> 'field' = 'value'` now works on encrypted JSON columns, in both the simple and extended query protocols, and in the `->>` and `jsonb_path_query_first(col, path) = value` spellings. `<>` is supported as the negation. The field and the value are combined into a single encrypted value-selector needle and matched by containment, so a query never reveals the field and value separately. Matching is exact and case-sensitive; the value must be a JSON scalar (comparing a whole object or array to a field is rejected — use containment with `@>` instead).

### Security

- **Chained JSON field accessors sent the intermediate field name to the database in plaintext**: `WHERE col -> 'a' -> 'b' = $1` on an encrypted JSON column emitted `eql_v3.jsonb_contains(col -> 'a', …)`, so the field name `a` appeared in the statement text PostgreSQL received (and in its logs), and native `jsonb ->` was applied to the encrypted payload — which also made the predicate match nothing. A chain is now treated as the single path it is: `$.a.b` of the whole document, folded into the one encrypted needle and matched against the bare column. Chains of any depth are supported, in the `->`, `->>` and `jsonb_path_query_first` spellings, with `=` and `<>`, and with each step written as a literal or a placeholder.

### Fixed

- **Statement errors no longer desync the connection**: when a statement failed inside the proxy (an unsupported operation on an encrypted column, for instance), the error was written straight to the client and could overtake responses still in flight from the server — with connection pools and prepared-statement caching, the client then saw a protocol error (`unexpected message from server` in tokio_postgres) instead of the proxy's message, typically right after an encrypted statement had run on the same connection. The proxy now delivers statement errors through the server, so clients always receive the proxy's actual error message, in order, and the connection remains usable.

- **A param bound as both a stored value and a query operand**: `UPDATE t SET enc = $1 WHERE enc = $1` failed with a domain CHECK violation. The two occurrences need different payloads — the stored one carries the ciphertext, the query one only search terms — but the role was tracked per input param, so marking the param as a query operand stripped the ciphertext from the value being stored. The role is now taken from the rewritten statement, per occurrence.

- **JSON selector params when the client declares its own types**: a client that sends param OIDs in Parse (pgx in `cache_describe` mode, for example) got `function eql_v3.jsonb_path_exists(eql_v3_json_search, jsonb) does not exist`. A JSON field selector is passed to the rewritten function as bare text, but was being declared as `jsonb` like every other encrypted operand. Affects `->`, `->>`, `jsonb_path_exists`, `jsonb_path_query` and `jsonb_path_query_first`.

- **Binary-format text operands on encrypted JSON fields**: a TEXT/VARCHAR operand arriving in binary format was handed straight to the JSON decoder and rejected, even though the same value in text format was accepted. Textual types are now read as a string first and then given the text format's treatment, so `Alice` behaves like `"Alice"`.

- **Aggregates over a grouped encrypted column**: `SELECT MIN(enc) FROM t GROUP BY enc` produced `grouped_value(eql_v3.min(enc))` — an aggregate inside an aggregate, which PostgreSQL rejects. An aggregate already returns one value per group, so it is no longer lifted; only a direct projection of the grouped column is.

- **`SELECT *` with `GROUP BY` on an encrypted column** is now rejected with an explanatory error instead of PostgreSQL's "column must appear in the GROUP BY clause". A wildcard hides the projected columns, so the grouped column cannot be projected through `eql_v3.grouped_value` — list the columns explicitly. This matches the existing treatment of `SELECT DISTINCT *`.

- **`SELECT DISTINCT *` skipped the encrypted-column protection**: a wildcard hides the columns `DISTINCT` deduplicates on, so neither the equality-term keying nor the capability check applied and duplicates were returned silently. The wildcard is now expanded to its columns, which are keyed like any other; a wildcard hiding a column with no equality term is rejected.

- **`@@` with the encrypted column on the right**: `'pattern' @@ col` produced `match_term('pattern') @> match_term(col)` — a backwards containment, with the pattern never encrypted, that silently matched nothing. `@@` is symmetric in PostgreSQL, so both spellings now produce the same query.

- **Encrypt config could pick up a same-named table from another schema**: the config is keyed on `(table, column)` while the schema query scanned every schema, so a table of the same name elsewhere — another tenant's, a staging copy — could overwrite the served one and give a column the wrong domain config or drop its encryption. The scan is now limited to the connection's search path, in precedence order.

- **A prepared statement name reused for an unmapped statement**: `Parse` rebinds its name, but a statement Proxy does not map — `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, or anything needing no type check — left the *previous* statement cached under that name. The next `Bind` for the name was then rewritten against a statement the client never parsed, failing with `Rewritten statement binds parameter 1, but only 0 were provided`. Affects any client that reuses the unnamed prepared statement across a transaction, which includes pgbench in extended mode and psycopg with `prepare=False`.

- **`LIKE`/`ILIKE` capability checking**: `LIKE` and `ILIKE` on an encrypted column are now gated by the column's token-match capability. Previously these predicates bypassed capability checking and were silently accepted on columns that do not support fuzzy match; they are now rejected with a capability error.

- **Upserts with `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` now encrypt the update path**: `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (…) DO UPDATE SET enc = …` previously left the `DO UPDATE` assignments untouched, so a plaintext value landed in the encrypted column unencrypted whenever the conflict path ran. Assignments are now typed and encrypted exactly like a plain `UPDATE … SET`, `excluded.<col>` references resolve to the column's encrypted type, and comparisons in the `DO UPDATE … WHERE` predicate are rewritten to their search terms. A conflict target naming an encrypted column (`ON CONFLICT (enc)`) is rejected: uniqueness there would be judged on the randomised ciphertext, so the conflict would never fire.

- **Window functions over an encrypted column**: the window's `ORDER BY` is now checked against the column's ordering capability (previously it was silently left ordering on raw ciphertext, whose order differs on every insert), and named window definitions (`OVER w` with `WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY enc …)`) get the same equality-term and ordering-term treatment as inline `OVER (…)` clauses, which previously escaped both checking and rewriting. `RANGE` frames with an offset over an encrypted sort key are rejected, since no search term supports the arithmetic they need; `ROWS` and `GROUPS` frames work.

- **`count(DISTINCT enc)` now counts distinct plaintexts**: the deduplication previously ran on whole encrypted payloads, whose ciphertext is randomised per row, so every value looked distinct and the count silently equalled the row count. The argument is now rewritten to the column's equality term. `DISTINCT` with an encrypted argument in any other aggregate is rejected (the substitution would change that aggregate's result), as is an aggregate-internal `ORDER BY` (`array_agg(x ORDER BY enc)`) on a column with no ordering term — where the capability exists, the key is rewritten to its ordering term.

- **`WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY enc)` is now rejected**: an ordered-set aggregate (`percentile_disc`, `mode`, …) computes its result from the sort key, so on an encrypted column it would hand the client an opaque search term. Previously the clause escaped type checking entirely.

- **`SELECT … INTO` an encrypted column is now rejected**: the statement copies data into a table the encryption schema has never seen, leaving unreachable ciphertext there. Native-only projections pass through as before.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **ZeroKMS authentication failures ~15 minutes after startup (access keys)**: Fixed the root cause of access tokens never being renewed when authenticating with an access key. The token's lifetime was misread, so renewal never triggered and every encrypt/decrypt operation began failing (`ZeroKMS error: Request not authorized`, "Could not decrypt data") roughly 15 minutes — the token lifetime — after connecting, recovering only on restart. Tokens now renew correctly ahead of expiry. This resolves the remaining cases not addressed by the 2.2.3 fix.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **ZeroKMS authentication failures ~15 minutes after startup**: Fixed an issue in the access-key authentication path where, after an in-flight request was interrupted at the wrong moment (for example, a client disconnecting mid-query), access-token renewal could stall. This caused `ZeroKMS error: Request not authorized` on all encrypt/decrypt operations roughly 15 minutes (the access-token lifetime) after connecting — connections worked on startup and then began failing in lockstep.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- **Passthrough mode memory leak**: Fixed a per-statement memory leak that occurred in passthrough mode (empty encrypt config), where per-statement queues were not drained. Long-running connections could grow unbounded and eventually OOM. ([#400](https://github.com/cipherstash/proxy/issues/400))

## [2.2.1] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **OPE (Order-Preserving Encryption) index**: New `ope` index type alongside the existing `ore` for range and `ORDER BY` queries on encrypted columns. Drop-in alternative to `ore` — pick one per column. See the [encrypted indexes documentation](docs/how-to/index.md) for configuration.

## [2.2.0-alpha.1] - 2026-03-25

### Changed

- **Log target renamed**: `KEYSET` log target renamed to `ZEROKMS`. The environment variable `CS_LOG__KEYSET_LEVEL` is now `CS_LOG__ZEROKMS_LEVEL`.

### Removed

- **Log target removed**: `PROXY` log target and `CS_LOG__PROXY_LEVEL` environment variable have been removed.

### Added

- **Cipher cache miss metric**: New Prometheus counter `cipherstash_proxy_keyset_cipher_cache_miss_total` tracks cache misses requiring cipher initialization. This complements the `cipherstash_proxy_keyset_cipher_cache_hits_total` metric, and can be used to calculate cache hit/miss ratio.
- **Cipher init duration metric**: New Prometheus histogram `cipherstash_proxy_keyset_cipher_init_duration_seconds` tracks cipher initialization time including ZeroKMS network calls.
- **Encrypt/decrypt timing**: Debug logs for `encrypt_eql` and `decrypt_eql` now include `duration_ms`.
- **Cache eviction logging**: ScopedCipher cache eviction events are now logged under the `ZEROKMS` target.
- **Slow cipher init warning**: Cipher initialization taking longer than 1 second triggers a warning log.

## [2.1.22] - 2026-02-05

### Added

- **Configurable slow database response threshold**: The "Slow database response" log threshold is now configurable via `CS_LOG__SLOW_DB_RESPONSE_MIN_DURATION_MS` (default: 100ms). This controls per-message logging for individual slow reads from the PostgreSQL server.

## [2.1.21] - 2026-02-04

### Changed

- Updated `cipherstash-client` to v0.33.0. Adds `array_index_mode` configuration for STE-VEC indexes, which controls how arrays are indexed in JSONB data. Defaults to `all` (generating item, wildcard, and positional selectors), preserving backwards compatibility with existing configurations.

## [2.1.20] - 2026-01-29

### Added

- **Slow statement logging**: Enable with `CS_LOG__SLOW_STATEMENTS=true` to log detailed timing breakdowns when queries exceed a configurable threshold (default 2 seconds). Includes breakdown of parse, encrypt, server wait, and decrypt phases.
- **Prometheus slow statement counter**: New `cipherstash_proxy_slow_statements_total` metric increments when slow statements are detected.
- **Prometheus histogram labels**: Duration histograms now include `statement_type`, `protocol`, `mapped`, and `multi_statement` labels for granular performance analysis.
- **Term filters for STE-VEC indexes**: Support for `term_filters` configuration in `eql_v2.add_search_config()`, enabling case-insensitive JSONB queries with the `downcase` filter.
